# FarmingManagementSystem
This project is written using Python. This project is based on Farming Management System.
Linked list has been used in this project.
The farmers will create their accounts. They will have their own temporary database (temporary because it is a pure python project, no database has been added to it, therefore the data will be lost once the program terminates). The farmers will login into their accounts through the farmer ID provided by the program itself. They will upload the items they want to sell with the price and the amount of item they are uploading.
The customer on the other hand will be able to view all the items uploaded by the individual farmers with their manipulated farmer ID (the farmer ID viewed to the customer will be different from the actual one, for security reasons). If the customer wishes to buy the item, he buys it otherwise presses -1.
The amount of money the customer will pay for the bought item, will be reflected in the earning of that farmer.
The farmers will be able to remove their accounts from the database if they want.
